# 3D creature
 
The creature will spawn 15 links that have a 50% chance of becoming a sensor neuron. Each link can heights, width, and length range between 0.2 and 1. When a sensor neuron is activated, it should change the front motor neuron. Body generation will choose from random available faces from each link. Min and max x, y, z are remembered for each link to use for overlapping checks. Run the search function to generate and show a creature.
